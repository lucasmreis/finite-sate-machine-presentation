Did you go from 

## Infinite Planning

to 

## No Planning At All

?

---

### We are getting too far on the other side of the pendulum

---

_Wait, are you bringing back WATERFALL???_

---

No, I'm only claiming we need **some** planning

_not two months, but something from two hours to two days!_

---

1. Coding is more **costly** than planning
2. We are able to solve **big problems** and catch bugs with planning
3. During planning we're able to leverage knowledge of **non-coders** too 

---

## Finite State Machines are a great tool for planning UIs

### What Are Finite State Machines?

1. A list of **states**
2. One **initial** state
3. A list of events that trigger **transitions**
4. Transitions may be conditional (**guards**)
5. A state can trigger **actions** upon entering or exiting a state

### Statecharts FTW

We just need to expand it a bit...

### Statecharts FTW

---

### Statecharts FTW

1. Hierachy: states can have **substates**
2. Parallelism: the system may have **multiple** machines
3. Broadcasting: one machine can react to events sent by **other** machines

---

Statecharts are: 

* High-level enough to be able to be developed by non-coders
* Low-level enough to actually help you with your code

---

### Let's implement a React component using a statechart!

---

Insurance Picker

(show it)

---

Prototype With Sketch.systems

--- 

Create statechart in xviz

---

Use React Automata to create component

---

Benefits of using it

---

Future possibilities
